Tradeoffs of managing a small stormwater system for quantity, quality, and ecological goals

abstract:
Recent research has applied real-time sensing and control theory to stormwater systems for improving water quantity metrics such as flooding and erosion, as well as water quality metrics like nutrient (e.g., nitrate, phosphorus) removal. Meanwhile, ecological management often relies on a combination of experiential heuristics and manual interventions that are limited in data assimilation and the timeliness and precision of control. This work begins to bring ecosystem management into the smart city space by applying real-time control tools to a wetland system. First, a state space model is constructed to represent the influence of water level fluctuations on a wetland ecosystem. Then several control strategies are applied to a simulated network under historical precipitation to examine the tradeoffs and synergies of managing a simulated stormwater network for quantity, quality, or ecological goals. Despite the limitations of a linear representation of wetland dynamics, results suggest that water quality and ecological goals may have synergies. Further, there is also evidence that control strategies already adopted for quantity and quality goals may be positively impacting ecosystems. There is fruitful work ahead in constructing better control-amenable models for wetland dynamics. Likewise, real-time ecological state estimation would improve these methods.
